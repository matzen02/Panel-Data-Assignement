# Panel Data Analysis Assignments â€“ Tilburg University

This repository contains the two assignments from my *Panel Data Analysis* course at Tilburg University. The analysis and code were developed using **Stata**.

## Topics Covered

- Introduction to panel data and its structure combining cross-sectional and time series information  
- Fixed effects models to control for unobserved heterogeneity  
- Random effects models and Hausman test for model selection  
- Difference-in-differences (DiD) estimation for causal inference  
- Dynamic panel data models using Arellano-Bond estimators and GMM  
- Addressing endogeneity with instrumental variables in panel data  
- Model diagnostics including tests for serial correlation and heteroscedasticity  
- Empirical applications and interpretation of results in economic contexts

## Repository Contents

- **Assignment 1:** Theory and applications of core panel data techniques with detailed answers and code examples  
- **Assignment 2:** Advanced methods including binary choice models, instrumental variables, and dynamic panel models with comprehensive solutions

Feel free to explore the PDFs and scripts to understand the methodologies and empirical strategies employed.
